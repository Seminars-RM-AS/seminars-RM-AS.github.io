            <p><b> Abstract: Research by Deng et al.(2023) suggests that, amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, stocks with higher transition risk demonstrated better performance, indicating an expected deceleration in the transition process. This trend was notably more significant in the US compared to Europe. Also, with the recent outperformance of the energy sector, there is a huge backlash from plan participants against pension plans that decide to divest. A recent example is the New York City Pension Funds being sued for divesting from fossil fuels. With the rise of the divestment movement and the escalation of climate-related demonstrations, managers of pension plans find themselves at a critical juncture. Some plan participants argue that the sole purpose of pension plans is to enhance the wealth of their participants. Meanwhile, others contend that the fiduciary duty of pension plans includes promoting sustainability. Additionally, some participants agree that the primary goal of plans is wealth maximization but emphasize that this objective extends beyond the short term to encompass long-term considerations. They argue that since there are policies incentivizing sustainability, investing in sustainable stocks becomes imperative. Pension plans now face a pivotal decision between optimizing short-term returns or divesting from carbon-intensive sectors. In this research, we conduct a numerical experiment that explores the different opinions of these pension plan participants. </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: Duet expectile preferences </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Qinyu Wu (Postdoc Fellow, University of Waterloo) </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: We introduce a novel axiom of co-loss aversion for a preference relation over the space of acts, represented by measurable functions in a suitable measurable space. This axioms means that the decision maker, facing the sum of two acts, dislikes the situation where both acts realize as losses simultaneously.  Our main result is that, under strict monotonicity and continuity, the axiom of co-loss aversion characterizes preference relations represented by a new class of functionals, which we call the duet expectiles. A duet expectile involves two endogenous probability measures, and it becomes a usual expectile, a statistical quantity popular in regression and risk measures, when these two probability measures coincide.  We discuss properties of duet expectiles and connections with fundamental concepts including probabilistic sophistication, risk aversion, and uncertainty aversion. </b></p>

            <p><b> Title: A representation-learning approach for insurance pricing with images </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Christopher Blier-Wong (Postdoc Fellow, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time:  15:00 - 16:00 pm, Mar 14, 2024 (Thu) </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: Unstructured data are a promising new source of information that insurance companies may use to understand their risk portfolio better and improve the customer experience. However, these novel data sources are difficult to incorporate into existing ratemaking frameworks due to the size and format of the unstructured data. This paper proposes a framework to use street view imagery within a generalized linear model. To do so, we use representation learning to extract an embedding vector containing useful information from the image. This embedding is dense and low-dimensional, making it appropriate to use within existing ratemaking models. We find that there is useful information included in street view imagery to predict the frequency of claims for certain types of perils. This model can be used as-is in a ratemaking framework but also opens the door to future empirical research on attempting to extract which characteristics within the image leads to increased or decreased predicted claim frequencies. Throughout, we discuss the practical difficulties (technical and social) of using this type of data for insurance pricing.
