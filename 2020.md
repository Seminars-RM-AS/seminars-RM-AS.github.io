            <p><b> Abstract: In this paper, we analyse the set of all possible aggregate distributions of the sum of standard uniform random variables, a simply stated yet challenging problem in the literature of distributions with given margins. Our main results are obtained for two distinct cases. In the case of dimension two, we obtain four partial characterization results. For dimension greater than or equal to three, we obtain a full characterization of the set of aggregate distributions, which is the first complete characterization result of this type in the literature for any choice of continuous marginal distributions.</b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: We study optimal reinsurance in the framework of stochastic Stackelberg differential game, in which an insurer and a reinsurer are the two players, and more specifically are considered as the follower and the leader of the Stackelberg game, respectively. An optimal reinsurance policy is determined by the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game, consisting of an optimal reinsurance strategy chosen by the insurer and an optimal reinsurance premium strategy by the reinsurer. Both the insurer and the reinsurer aim to maximize their respective mean–variance cost functionals. To overcome the time- inconsistency issue in the game, we formulate the optimization problem of each player as an embedded game and solve it via a corresponding extended Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. It is found that the Stackelberg equilibrium can be achieved by the pair of a variance reinsurance premium principle and a proportional reinsurance treaty, or that of an expected value reinsurance premium principle and an excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty.</b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: Peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance is a decentralized network in which participants pool their resources together to compensate those who suffer losses. Despite the fast-changing landscape in this field, there has been no previous academic literature on the theoretical underpinning of P2P insurance. This paper presents the first effort to build the framework for the design and engineering of mutual aid and P2P insurance. Most of existing business models are developed to insure against a particular risk. This paper presents a variety of P2P insurance/mutual aid models that facilitate the exchange of multiple risks and enable peers with different needs to financially support each other in a transparent and fair way. </b></p>

To show how the method works on data, and how to interpret results and make appropriate decisions, we illustrate the method when genuine inputs are ARMA time series and systematic risks (e.g., measurement errors) are sequences of iid random variables.

            <p><b> Abstract: We study a problem in the principal-agent model of two general S-shaped utilities without explicit expressions, where the two parties have different reference points. The problem is featured with a principal's participating incentive compatible constraint, which particularly stands in the context of asset management with motivation to safeguard the benefit of the principal. After a thorough investigation, it turns out to be a complicated double S-shaped utility optimization problem. We propose a new classification approach to study the optimal final asset allocation. First, it is classified into two cases: (a) One-side-loss Case in which either both parties suffer liquidation, or one gains and the other loses, or both make profit; (b) Option Case in which either both parties suffer liquidation or both make profit. Further, we demonstrate an asymptotic classification of the optimal asset allocation that the single utility maximization of the principal is the limit of the Option Case, while that of the agent is the limit of the One-side-loss Case. More importantly, we find a division reservation utility which the optimal asset allocation belongs to the Option Case beyond and to the One-side-loss Case below. Thus, the key factor resulting in different risk choices is the size of the reservation utility. As an application, we numerically visualize these results with a specific participating contract, which illustrates some novel mechanisms in asset management.</b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: Classical formulations of the portfolio optimization problem, such as mean-variance or Value-at-Risk (VaR) approaches, can result in a portfolio extremely sensitive to errors in the data, such as mean and covariance matrix of the returns. These two papers instead assumed the distribution of returns is partially known and considered the problem of computing the worst-case VaR and the worst-case CVaR, respectively, with respect to several types of model uncertainties. The both papers showed the problems can be converted into convex problems and hence are tractable. </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: Optimization of distortion riskmetrics with distributional uncertainty has wide applications in finance and operations research. Distortion riskmetrics include many commonly applied risk measures and deviation measures, which are not necessarily monotone or convex. One of our central findings is a unifying result which allows us to freely transform the optimization of a non-convex distortion riskmetric to that of a convex one, giving rise to great tractability in many practical problems. Key to the main unifying equivalence result, we introduce the notion of closedness under concentration for the set of plausible distributions. Our result includes many special cases that are well studied in the optimization literature, including but not limited to optimizing probability, Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall, and Yaari's dual utility under various forms of distributional uncertainty. We illustrate our theoretical results via applications to portfolio optimization, optimization under moment constraints, and preference robust optimization. </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: We consider the problem of active portfolio management where a loss-averse and/or risk-seeking investor aims to outperform a benchmark strategy's risk profile while staying ``close'' to the benchmark. Specifically, an investor considers alternative strategies whose (a) cost does not exceed that of the benchmark's, (b) whose terminal wealth and that of the benchmark's is comonotonic, and (c) whose terminal wealth lies within a Wasserstein ball around the benchmark's. The investor's personal risk profile is modelled by minimising a distortion risk measure. We prove that the optimal dynamic strategy exists and is unique, and provide a characterisation of the optimal strategy through the notion of isotonic projections. Moreover, we illustrate how investors with different risk preferences invest using the Tail Value-at-Risk and inverse S-shaped risk measures as examples. </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: We address the problem of estimating and comparing transformed rank correlation coefficients defined as Pearson’s linear correlation between two random variables transformed by a so-called concordance-inducing function. The class of transformed rank correlations includes Spearman’s rho, Blomqvist’s beta and van der Waerden’s coefficient as special cases by taking uniform, Bernoulli and normal distributions as concordance-inducing functions, respectively. We propose a novel framework for comparing transformed rank correlations in terms of the asymptotic variance of their canonical estimators. A general criterion derived from this framework is that concordance-inducing functions with smaller variances of squared random variables are more preferable. In particular, we show that Blomqvist’s beta attains the optimal asymptotic variance and Spearman’s rho outperforms van der Waerden’s coefficient. We also find that the optimal bounds of the asymptotic variance are attained by Kendall’s tau. </b></p>

Second, we introduce some methodologies to construct joint mix copulas with margins from a common location-scale family, including the so-called recursive method and geometric method. Via our method, we can construct a large family of joint mix copulas with sufficient flexibility. Third, we investigate the simulation of joint mix distributions via the related copulas and provide some numerical illustrations.

            <p><b> Abstract: We consider the following question: given information on individual policyholder characteristics, how can we ensure that insurance prices do not discriminate with respect to protected characteristics, such as gender? We address the issues of direct and indirect discrimination, the latter meaning that protected characteristics are implicitly learned (“proxied”) from non-protected ones. We provide mathematical definitions for direct and indirect discrimination and introduce a simple formula for discrimination-free pricing, which avoids both direct and indirect discrimination. This formula works in any statistical model. We demonstrate its application on a health insurance example, using a generalized linear model and a neural network regression model. An important conclusion is that discrimination-free pricing in general requires collection of policyholders’ discriminatory characteristics, posing potential challenges in relation to policyholder’s privacy concerns. Moving towards application of this approach in practice raises further questions, which I aim to discuss in the seminar. This is a joint work with M. Lindholm, R. Richman, M.V. Wuethrich. </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: In this paper we first investigate the 
ordering relationship between aggregation sets where the marginal risks 
from different sets are related by some simple operations, such as 
distribution-mixture or quantile-mixture defined by doubly stochastic 
matrices.  It turns out that the aggregation set after operating a 
distribution-mixture becomes larger for general marginal distributions. 
However, the aggregation sets are not comparable under quantile-mixture 
operations in general. Our results on orders of aggregation sets imply 
that distribution-mixture operations on marginal risks can increase the 
worst-case values of risk measures for general marginal risks and 
general law-invariant risk measures. If all marginal distributions have 
decreasing densities,  we show that quantile-mixture operations can 
produce a larger worst-case value of a specific regulatory risk measure,
 Value-at-Risk (VaR). We particularly focus on the worst-case values of 
risk measure for Pareto marginal distributions to obtain more specific 
inequalities related to the simple operations. Our results can be used 
to compare the the worst-case values of risk measures on two risk 
aggregations where no stochastic dominance exists between them.  
Numerical studies are conducted to illustrate our findings on 
inequalities for the worst-case values of VaR. </b></p>
