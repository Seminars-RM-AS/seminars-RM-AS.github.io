# Weekly Seminars on <br/> Risk Management and Actuarial Science

<b>The weekly seminar series is a venue for international scholars in risk management and actuarial science to discuss research advances and exchange ideas. Junior researchers are the most encouraged to present their recent work, including on-going projects. The list of current and past speakers includes scholars from Canada, US, China, Japan, Australia, Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany and France. </b>

* <b>To volunteer yourself or propose a speaker for a research presentation, please contact the organizers by email. </b>

* <b>We will send out weekly reminders via a mailing list, usually on the day before the presentation. Papers and presentation slides will be circulated among participants via the mailing list. If you would like to be included in the list, please contact the organizers.</b>

* <b>In this year of 2024, most seminars are held in person at the University of Waterloo.

            <p><b> Title: Portfolio decarbonization </b></p>
            <p><b> Speaker: Rhoda Dadzie-Dennis (PhD Candidate, University of Waterloo) </b></p>
            <p><b> Time:  15:00 - 16:00 pm, Apr 18, 2024 (Thu) </b></p>

            <p><b> Abstract: Research by Deng et al.(2023) suggests that, amid the Russia-Ukraine conflict, stocks with higher transition risk demonstrated better performance, indicating an expected deceleration in the transition process. This trend was notably more significant in the US compared to Europe. Also, with the recent outperformance of the energy sector, there is a huge backlash from plan participants against pension plans that decide to divest. A recent example is the New York City Pension Funds being sued for divesting from fossil fuels. With the rise of the divestment movement and the escalation of climate-related demonstrations, managers of pension plans find themselves at a critical juncture. Some plan participants argue that the sole purpose of pension plans is to enhance the wealth of their participants. Meanwhile, others contend that the fiduciary duty of pension plans includes promoting sustainability. Additionally, some participants agree that the primary goal of plans is wealth maximization but emphasize that this objective extends beyond the short term to encompass long-term considerations. They argue that since there are policies incentivizing sustainability, investing in sustainable stocks becomes imperative. Pension plans now face a pivotal decision between optimizing short-term returns or divesting from carbon-intensive sectors. In this research, we conduct a numerical experiment that explores the different opinions of these pension plan participants. </b></p>
